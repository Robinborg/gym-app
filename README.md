# Gym App
Web app to keep track of your gym training.<br/>
Try it yourself https://robinborg.github.io/gym-app/

## Reason
Wanted to make an app that uses the information provided in this podcast:
>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-andy-galpin-how-to-build-strength-muscle-size-and-endurance/
- Main timer 60:00 minutes<br/>
- 3 to 5 exercises<br/>
- 3 to 5 times a week<br/>
- 3 to 5 sets<br/>
- 3 to 5 reps<br/>
- 3 to 5 minutes rest<br/>
If you are working for strength use 85 % of maximum<br/>
If you are working for power use 40% to 70 % of maximum, because power = speed * strength


## Gym app layout
- Main timer keeping track of time, default 60 minutes
- Track workouts and highlight current workout, show current set of sets
- Show current reps, increments sets
- Pause button: 3 to 5 minutes rest, increments to reps
